# Sketch Replace Hue

![Sketch Replace Hue](/Replacecolor.sketchplugin/Contents/Resources/replacehue.gif?raw=true)

Sketch Replace Hue is forked from Sketch Replace color, and can be used to Find and Replace the same Hues found on the Fill, Border and Text color properties of your layers. 

The main purpose of this plugin is to allow for very fast theme swapping across your entire document's palette. By effectively targetting only the HUE property of a color, we leave the tinted/shaded/saturated/desaturated/transparent variations intact.

*IMPORTANT* - For Sketch Replace Hue to work, the layers selected MUST be in an artboard.
